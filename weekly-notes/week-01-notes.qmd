## Key Concepts Learned
- [List main concepts from lecture]
- [Technical skills covered]
**Main Class Tools**
- Github
- Quarto
  - Similar to RMarkdown
    - Better site creation and language flexibility
  - Integration of code, text, and output (so basically RMarkdown)
  - Why?
    - Reproductable research
    - Professional Presentations
  - Career Relevance
    - "Industry standard"
    - Creates sites, pdfs, presentations
  - Formatting
    - Text

## Coding Techniques
- [New R functions or approaches]
- [Quarto features learned]

**Tidyverse Review**

- Why Tibbles?
  - Smarter printing
- Essential dplyr functions (you know these dummy)
  - `select()` -- choose columns
  - `filter()` -- choose rows i.e. `youngCars <- filter(carData, oldCars == "Not Old")`
  - `&` -- syntax for AND
  - `|` -- syntax for OR
  - `mutate()` -- create new variables
    - Use `case_when()` as if statement i.e. `carData <- mutate(carData, oldCars = case_when(age > 20 ~ "old", TRUE ~ "Not Old"))`
  - `summarize()` -- create statistics
  - `group_by()` -- operate on groups condenses rows by column values (works with `summarize()` like pb & jelly)
- Piping
  - `%>%` -- syntax for pipe
  - read as "then"
  - connects lines of code to minimize outputs
